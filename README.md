native-slider
=============

CSS-only slider with native browser scrolling and JS navigation buttons. Optimised for mobile without mobile-specific code. Multiple sliders on one page. 5K gzipped.

Usage: Add native-slider.css and native-slider.min.js to a page and wrap the slides with a ".slider" container.

How it works: The slides are lined up horizontally with "display: inline-block" and prevented from dropping below by "white-space: normal". The sliding action is native browser scrolling.
